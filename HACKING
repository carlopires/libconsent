Required Deps: libzeromq, libstdc++
Optional: glibcxx (backtrace() for assertion failure logging)

Building with a different assertion scheme (note the trailing underscore):
  make ASSERTLEVEL=-DLIBCONSENT_ASSERT_LOG_=\\\"abc.log\\\" clean all
  make ASSERTLEVEL=-DLIBCONSENT_ASSERT_HARD_ clean all

Caveat about assertion logging: Build with -rdynamic if you want function
names in the log. If not, you can use:
  `cat log.log | addr2line -e your.exe -f -C -p'.
to get at the trace.
