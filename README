libconsent is a C++ library which provides an interface for fault-tolerant
logging (implemented with paxos).

Our primary goals are correctness, robustness, and simplicity. To that end,
this work will be divided into two parts; a lower-level "bare bones" paxos
library, and a higher-level library sitting on top of the lower-level one
providing convenient additional functionality. Group membership management,
log truncation management, "master" lease semantics, and history "catch-up"
are all features left for the higher-level library.
